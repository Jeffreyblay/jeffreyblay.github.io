**Presentation Topic: A 3D perspective of analysing the effect of Hurricane Matthew in small communities: A case study of Grifton, NC.**

I presented at the 2024 Annual ASPRS and Geo Week Conference, sharing my research on 3D geospatial mapping of Hurricane Matthew’s impact on the small community in Grifton, NC. The international event provided a platform to highlight how advanced spatial tools can support post-disaster assessment and community resilience.
