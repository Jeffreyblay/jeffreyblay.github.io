Our research was presented at the 2024 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS). The presentation explored the use of artificial intelligence and large-scale geospatial data to generate 3D flood maps, providing actionable insights for disaster preparedness and safeguarding built infrastructure. Delivered to an international audience, this work demonstrates innovative approaches to urban flood risk assessment and resilient planning.
