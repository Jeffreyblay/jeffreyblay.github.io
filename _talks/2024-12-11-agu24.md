**Presentation Title:** Urban Flood Depth Analytics: Leveraging Generative Algorithms and Remote Sensing for 3D Flood Depth Simulation.
I presented my research on using generative algorithms and remote sensing data to simulate 3D urban flood depths. The work demonstrates how advanced computational techniques can enhance flood risk analysis and support infrastructure resilience in urban environments. Delivered to an international audience, the presentation highlighted innovative approaches for predictive flood modeling and data-driven urban planning.
