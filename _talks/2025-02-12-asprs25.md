At the 2025 ASPRS and GeoWeek Conference, I presented on leveraging large-scale geospatial data and conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to perform 3D floodwater depth analytics. The presentation highlighted how AI-driven modeling combined with big geo-data can enhance flood risk assessment and support resilient infrastructure planning. Delivered to an international audience, the work showcases cutting-edge techniques in geospatial analytics and predictive flood modeling.
