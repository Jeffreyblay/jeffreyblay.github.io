**Presentation Title:** Leveraging AI and big geo-data for 3D flood depth mapping to safeguard-built assets.
At the 2024 NCAUG conference, I presented on leveraging artificial intelligence and large-scale geospatial data to generate 3D flood depth maps. The presentation demonstrated how these tools can provide actionable insights for disaster preparedness and the protection of built infrastructure. Delivered to a U.S.-based audience, the work highlights practical applications of AI and GIS in urban flood risk management and resilience planning.
