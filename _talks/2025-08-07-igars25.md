Our research on applying deep learning techniques to map floodwater depths in urban and settlement areas was presented at the 2025 IGARSS Conference research. The presentation showcased how combining high-resolution remote sensing data with AI algorithms can transform raw pixels into actionable insights for flood risk assessment and infrastructure protection. Delivered to an international audience, the work emphasizes the role of advanced computational methods in enhancing urban resilience and disaster preparedness.
