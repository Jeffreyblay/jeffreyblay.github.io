I am Jeffrey Blay, a passionate and ambitious individual who believes in turning the  
**"IMPOSSIBLE"** into **"I’M POSSIBLE"** through dedication and perseverance.
I am an aspiring **Geospatial Data Scientist/Engineer**, interested in applying data science  
and engineering techniques to extract meaningful insights from complex data to solve real-world problems.
Currently, I am pursuing a **Ph.D. in Applied Science**, specializing in **Geospatial Data Science**,  
with **years of experience** in applying machine learning techniques for spatial modeling and analytics.
I am seeking a **Summer 2026 internship** in data science or geospatial analytics to  
leverage my technical expertise and contribute to impactful projects.
