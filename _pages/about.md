I am Jeffrey Blay, a passionate and ambitious individual who believes in turning the  
**"IMPOSSIBLE"** into **"I’M POSSIBLE"** through dedication and perseverance.

I am an aspiring **Geospatial Data Scientist/Engineer**, interested in applying data science  
and engineering techniques to extract meaningful insights from complex data.

Currently, I am pursuing a **Ph.D. in Applied Science**, specializing in **Geospatial Data Science**,  
with over **3 years of experience** applying machine learning and deep learning for spatial modeling  
and analytics.

I am seeking a **Summer 2026 internship** in data science or geospatial analytics to  
leverage my technical expertise and contribute to impactful projects.
