**Abstract**
The rapid urbanization taken place in Africa and its accompanying urban expansion is having several environmental ramifications that need urgent attention to achieve sustainable urban development. This study assessed the spatial and temporal extent of urban expansion and resultant land surface temperature (LST) changes in the Awutu Senya East Municipal, Ghana. Landsat 7 satellite images between 1991 and 2018 were classified into four categories: Built-Up, Vegetation, Barren Land and Water. The LST and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) values were extracted from the satellite images and analyzed. Results of the study showed significant increase in Built-Up areas within the study period and also demonstrated a positive correlation between the expansion of constructed areas and increases in LST and NDBI values. Rapid urbanization was found to account for the loss in vegetation cover in the study area leading to increased LST and NDBI values. The study therefore recommends tree planting by residents of Awutu Senya, the enforcement of regulations on the choice of building materials, as well as provision of an effective transport system to aid the minimization of the observed high LST values.
